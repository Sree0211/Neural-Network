# Neural-Network
Text recognition using Feed forward Neural network

We try to use a (already trained) neural network to recognize hand-written digits.

We create a network with 3 layers. The input layer has 784 neurons, corresponding to the pixel values of a 28 x 28 image. The values encode shades of gray ranging from white (0) to black (1). The hidden layer shall have 800 neurons and the output layer 10 neurons. The first two layers have an additional bias neuron.

We set the weights of the network to those from the file weights.mat. The weights have been generated by training the network on a set of almost 60000 handwritten digits. The training was such that E(y; ^y) was minimized on the training set. The true result vector ^y has a +1 for the neuron that corresponded to the digit that the training image represented and -1 for all other output neurons. 

The training set train and a second set test (not used for training) can be loaded from the file digits.mat. Both are cell arrays with ten cells, corresponding to digits 0 to 9. Each cell is a N x 784 matrix that contains N different handwritten digits. For instance test{1}(3,:) would be a valid vector for the input_layer. It corresponds to the third image of digit 0 from the test set.

We then plot a few of those test digits and Use them as inputs to your neural network and compute the outputs. We check whether the digits recognized correctly. Latee, we test our network with complete test set.
